# K-Means-Clustering
K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to solve the clustering problems in machine learning or data science. K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.
